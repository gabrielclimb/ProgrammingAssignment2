## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.

```

Finding the best hospital in a state

Write a function called best that take two arguments: 
    the 2-character abbreviated name of a state and an outcome name. 
    The function reads the outcome-of-care-measures.csv file and returns a character vector with the name of the hospital that has the best (i.e. lowest) 30-day mortality for the specified outcome in that state. The hospital name is the name provided in the Hospital.Name variable. The outcomes can be one of “heart attack”, “heart failure”, or “pneumonia”. Hospitals that do not have data on a particular outcome should be excluded from the set of hospitals when deciding the rankings.
Handling ties. If there is a tie for the best hospital for a given outcome, then the hospital names should be sorted in alphabetical order and the first hospital in that set should be chosen (i.e. if hospitals “b”, “c”, and “f” are tied for best, then hospital “b” should be returned).
ins
The function should use the following template.

    best <- function(state, outcome) {
            ## Read outcome data
            ## Check that state and outcome are valid
            ## Return hospital name in that state with lowest 30-day death
            ## rate
    
    }
The function should check the validity of its arguments. If an invalid state value is passed to best, the function should throw an error via the stop function with the exact message “invalid state”. If an invalid outcome value is passed to best, the function should throw an error via the stop function with the exact message “invalid outcome”.
```{r}
best  <- function(state, outcome){
    #Read outcome
    setwd( "/Users/gabrielsoares/Documents/Curso Data Analysis/rprog-data-ProgAssignment3-data")
    hospital_data <- read.csv("outcome-of-care-measures.csv", colClasses = "character")
    
    #state list 
    state_list <- unique(hospital_data[,7])
    
    #outcome list
    outcome_list  <- c("heart attack","heart failure", "pneumonia")
    
    #checking variables
    if (!state %in% state_list){
        stop(print("invalid state"))
    }
    else if (!outcome %in% outcome_list){
        stop(print("invalid outcome"))
    }
    
    #filtering hospital dataset by state name
    hospital_filtered  <- subset(hospital_data, State == state)  
    
    if (outcome == "heart attack") {
                outcome_column <- 11
    }
    else if (outcome == "heart failure") {
                outcome_column <- 17
    }
    else if (outcome == "pneumonia") {
                outcome_column <- 23
    }

    #taking out NA values for the column
    column_desired  <- as.numeric(hospital_filtered[, outcome_column])
    is_Na <- is.na(column_desired)
    desired_hospital_filtered <- hospital_filtered[!is_Na,]
    
    #find the hospitals in the rows with the minimum outcome value
    columns_considered <- as.numeric(desired_hospital_filtered[, outcome_column])
    desired_rows <- which(columns_considered == min(columns_considered))
    desired_hospitals <- desired_hospital_filtered[desired_rows, 2]
    
    #if there are multiple hospitals with the minimum outcome value, then
    #return the first hospital name from the alphabetically sorted hospital
    #names list
    if (length(desired_hospitals) > 1) {
            hospitals_sorted <- sort(desired_hospitals)
            hospitals_sorted[1]
    }
    else {
            desired_hospitals
    }
    
}
```

Ranking hospitals by outcome in a state

Write a function called rankhospital that takes three arguments: the 2-character abbreviated name of a state (state), an outcome (outcome), and the ranking of a hospital in that state for that outcome (num). The function reads the outcome-of-care-measures.csv file and returns a character vector with the name of the hospital that has the ranking specified by the num argument. For example, the call

    rankhospital("MD", "heart failure", 5)
    
would return a character vector containing the name of the hospital with the 5th lowest 30-day death rate for heart failure. The num argument can take values “best”, “worst”, or an integer indicating the ranking (smaller numbers are better). If the number given by num is larger than the number of hospitals in that state, then the function should return NA. Hospitals that do not have data on a particular outcome should be excluded from the set of hospitals when deciding the rankings.

Handling ties. It may occur that multiple hospitals have the same 30-day mortality rate for a given cause of death. In those cases ties should be broken by using the hospital name. For example, in Texas (“TX”), the hospitals with lowest 30-day mortality rate for heart failure are shown here.

head(texas)
                        Hospital.Name Rate Rank
3935       FORT DUNCAN MEDICAL CENTER  8.1    1
4085  TOMBALL REGIONAL MEDICAL CENTER  8.5    2
4103 CYPRESS FAIRBANKS MEDICAL CENTER  8.7    3
3954           DETAR HOSPITAL NAVARRO  8.7    4
4010           METHODIST HOSPITAL,THE  8.8    5
3962  MISSION REGIONAL MEDICAL CENTER  8.8    6

Note that Cypress Fairbanks Medical Center and Detar Hospital Navarro both have the same 30-day rate (8.7). However, because Cypress comes before Detar alphabetically, Cypress is ranked number 3 in this scheme and Detar is ranked number 4. One can use the order function to sort multiple vectors in this manner (i.e. where one vector is used to break ties in another vector).
The function should use the following template.
rankhospital <- function(state, outcome, num = "best") {
        ## Read outcome data
}
## Check that state and outcome are valid
## Return hospital name in that state with the given rank
## 30-day death rate
The function should check the validity of its arguments. If an invalid state value is passed to rankhospital, the function should throw an error via the stop function with the exact message “invalid state”. If an invalid outcome value is passed to rankhospital, the function should throw an error via the stop function with the exact message “invalid outcome”.
Here is some sample output from the function.

```{r}
rankhospital  <- function(state, outcome, num = "best")
    {
    #Read outcome
    setwd( "/Users/gabrielsoares/Documents/Curso Data Analysis/rprog-data-ProgAssignment3-data")
    hospital_data <- read.csv("outcome-of-care-measures.csv", colClasses = "character")
    
    #state list 
    state_list <- unique(hospital_data[,7])
    
    #outcome list
    outcome_list  <- c("heart attack","heart failure", "pneumonia")
    
    #checking variables
        #first, state
    if (!state %in% state_list){
        stop(print("invalid state"))
    }
        #second, outcome
    else if (!outcome %in% outcome_list){
        stop(print("invalid outcome"))
    }
    
    #filtering hospital dataset by state name
    hospital_filtered  <- subset(hospital_data, State == state)  
    
    if (outcome == "heart attack") {
                outcome_column <- 11
    }
    else if (outcome == "heart failure") {
                outcome_column <- 17
    }
    else if (outcome == "pneumonia") {
                outcome_column <- 23
    }

    #taking out NA values for the column
    column_desired  <- as.numeric(hospital_filtered[, outcome_column])
    is_Na <- is.na(column_desired)
    desired_hospital_filtered <- hospital_filtered[!is_Na,]
    
    #converting to a numeric to order
    desired_hospital_filtered[,outcome_column]  <- sapply(desired_hospital_filtered[,outcome_column], as.numeric)
    
    #find the hospitals in the rows with the minimum outcome value
    columns_considered <- as.numeric(desired_hospital_filtered[, outcome_column])
    columns_names  <- as.character(desired_hospital_filtered[, 2])

    desired_hospitals_ordered  <- desired_hospital_filtered[with(desired_hospital_filtered,order(desired_hospital_filtered[outcome_column],desired_hospital_filtered[2])),]
    
    #if there are multiple hospitals with the minimum outcome value, then
    #return the first hospital name from the alphabetically sorted hospital
    #names list
    if (num == "best") {
            desired_hospitals_ordered[1,2]
    }
    else if (num == "worst") {
            desired_hospitals_ordered[length(desired_hospitals_ordered[,outcome_column]),2]
    }
    else {
        desired_hospitals_ordered[num,2]
    } 
        
}
```



    4 Ranking hospitals in all states
    
Write a function called rankall that takes two arguments: an outcome name (outcome) and a hospital ranking (num). The function reads the outcome-of-care-measures.csv file and returns a 2-column data frame containing the hospital in each state that has the ranking specified in num. For example the function call rankall("heart attack", "best") would return a data frame containing the names of the hospitals that are the best in their respective states for 30-day heart attack death rates. The function should return a value for every state (some may be NA). The first column in the data frame is named hospital, which contains the hospital name, and the second column is named state, which contains the 2-character abbreviation for the state name. Hospitals that do not have data on a particular outcome should be excluded from the set of hospitals when deciding the rankings.
Handling ties. The rankall function should handle ties in the 30-day mortality rates in the same way that the rankhospital function handles ties.
The function should use the following template.

rankall <- function(outcome, num = "best") {
        ## Read outcome data
}

## Check that state and outcome are valid
## For each state, find the hospital of the given rank
## Return a data frame with the hospital names and the
## (abbreviated) state name
NOTE: For the purpose of this part of the assignment (and for efficiency), your function should NOT call the rankhospital function from the previous section.
The function should check the validity of its arguments. If an invalid outcome value is passed to rankall, the function should throw an error via the stop function with the exact message “invalid outcome”. The num variable can take values “best”, “worst”, or an integer indicating the ranking (smaller numbers are better). If the number given by num is larger than the number of hospitals in that state, then the function should return NA.
Here is some sample output from the function.

```{r}

rankall <- function(outcome, num = "best"){
    ## Read outcome data
